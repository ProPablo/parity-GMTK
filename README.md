Made for the [GMTK 2021 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021) in 48 hours following the theme **Joined Together** using the Godot Engine. 

### Description
There are assets falling from the top of the screen in a random order. You control a black hole that is able to absorb and store 4 assets at a time, exceed that amount and you lose health points (of which you have 4). The goal of the game is to match the specified asset combinations onscreen before they expire otherwise you lose health. There are 7 acts, with you progressing through each one once 3 of the specified combinations have been made. 

### Appendix
Asset credits are listed on the [itch.io](https://sh-ggy.itch.io/parity) page in the About section of the repository.
